# Maui.XaleToolkit

Many native UI controls are still missing for * FREE * in .NET MAUI or the CommunityToolkit.

This repository aims to fill that gap by implementing some of them during my free time.  

## Implemented controls

| - | - | - |
| ðŸŸ¢ | ComboBox / SpinnerDropdown | **Android only** |

**Legend:**  
ðŸŸ¢ Fully functional  
ðŸŸ  Some issues, but still usable  
ðŸ”´ Critical issues or not yet implemented
